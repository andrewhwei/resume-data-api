#! Resume Data API  ( format: JSON )



If you just cloned this app from Github,
run the following commands in the terminal:

  $ bundle
  $ rake db:setup #=> rake db:create db:schema:load db:seed

* db:setup is a shortcut for creating, saving, and populating the database

Make sure you wait for all the data to compile or you might have to
deal with some painful database issues.
